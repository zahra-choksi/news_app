# News_edge : A Sample News Application

## Overview
News app is a sample Flutter application designed to showcase best practices in software architecture and design patterns. It follows Clean Architecture principles and employs the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management.

## Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy that separates the concerns of an application into layers, each with a specific responsibility. The layers typically include:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Handles UI-related logic and interacts with the BLoC layer.
2. **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic, usecase,entities .
3. **Data Layer**: Manages data access, including interactions with local and remote data sources.

The separation of concerns makes the codebase modular, scalable, and easy to maintain. Clean Architecture promotes testability and allows for the flexibility to change one layer without affecting others.

## Code Pattern: BLoC

BLoC is a state management pattern widely used in Flutter applications. It stands for Business Logic Component and separates the presentation layer from the business logic. Key components of the BLoC pattern include:

- **BLoC**: Manages the state of the application and contains business logic.
- **States**: Represent the state of the UI at a specific point in time.
- **Cubit**: A lightweight version of BLoC, suitable for simpler use cases.

BLoC simplifies the UI by removing business logic, making the application more modular and testable. It also provides a clear separation between the UI and business logic.

## Unit Testing

Unit testing is a crucial aspect of software development, ensuring the reliability and stability of the codebase.

Key testing libraries:

- **bloc_test**: Facilitates testing BLoC components.
- **mocktail**: Enables the creation of mock objects for testing.

Unit tests in News4U cover various scenarios, including testing BLoC behavior, error handling, and data interactions.

## Libraries Used

- **http**: A powerful HTTP client for making network requests.
- **shared_preferences**: Provides a simple way to persistently store and retrieve key-value pairs.
- **get_it**: A service locator for dependency injection, facilitating the management of object instances.
